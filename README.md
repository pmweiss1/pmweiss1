# Hi! 🐱🐈💗

My name is Paige and I'm a student at Arizona State. My major is in **Graphic Information Technology** with a focus in *Digital Design, Print, and Publishing*. I will be graduating with my Bachelor's in the Fall of 2025 and I hope to get a job as a Graphic Designer once I've completed school. 

Thanks for stopping by! 😁
